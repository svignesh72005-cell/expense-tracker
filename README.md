### 📌 Project Title

# Personal Expense Tracker using Python with CSV Storage

## 🎯 Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a menu-driven Personal Expense Tracker application using Python.
The system allows users to record, view, delete, and analyze their daily expenses using CSV file storage.

### 🛠 Technologies Used

* Python

* CSV Module

* File Handling

* VS Code

* Microsoft Excel (to view CSV file)

## 📂 Features

### 1️⃣ Add Expense

User enters:

Date (YYYY-MM-DD):

Category:

Amount:

Description:

Data is stored in data.csv.

### 2️⃣ View Expenses

* Reads data from CSV file

* Displays expenses in table format

* Shows serial number for each record

###  3️⃣ Delete Expense

* User selects expense number

* Selected record is removed

* File is rewritten with updated data

### 4️⃣ Monthly Summary

* User enters month (MM format)

* Program filters records by month

* Displays total expense for that month

## 💾 File Handling Concept

### The project uses:

1.open() function

2.Read mode ("r")

3.Write mode ("w")

4.Append mode ("a")

5.csv.reader()

6.csv.writer()

All expense data is stored in a CSV file (data.csv), ensuring permanent storage even after program exit.

### 🔄 Program Flow

* Display Menu

* User selects an option

* Corresponding function is executed

* Loop continues until user selects Exit

### 🧠 Python Concepts Used

* Functions

* While Loop

* For Loop

* Conditional Statements

* File Handling.

### Exception Handling

📊 Sample CSV Data:

2005-07-09,food,700,lunch

2007-09-08,travel,689,morning

## ✅ Conclusion:

This project demonstrates the practical implementation of Python programming concepts such as file handling, menu-driven applications, and data management using CSV storage.
It provides a simple and effective way to track daily expenses.
